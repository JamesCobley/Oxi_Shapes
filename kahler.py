# Kähler-Geometric Action Principle for Oxi-Shapes
# A semi-classical framework for redox-driven proteoform evolution

# 1. Define the state space manifold: discrete binary basis \mathfrak{H}_i
# Each state x in \mathfrak{H}_i is assigned:
#   - \rho(x): positional occupancy ("mass")
#   - R_real(x): intrinsic Ricci curvature from \rho(x)
#   - F_ext(x): external scalar field (oxidizing/reducing)

# 2. Action Functional (Discrete Kähler Action)
def kahler_action(rho, R_real, F_ext, measure):
    """
    Computes the total Kähler action over the discrete manifold.
    Inputs:
        rho     : array-like, occupancy field \rho(x)
        R_real  : array-like, intrinsic curvature R(x)
        F_ext   : array-like, external scalar field (oxidant/reductant forcing)
        measure : array-like, integration weights d\mu(x) (e.g. volume at each node)
    Returns:
        A       : complex-valued total action \mathcal{A}
    """
    import numpy as np
    A_real = np.sum(R_real * measure)                    # Intrinsic geometric action
    A_imag = np.sum(F_ext * measure)                    # External forcing action
    return A_real + 1j * A_imag

# 3. Define Ricci flow evolution (intrinsic)
def update_Ricci(rho, laplacian_operator, alpha=1.0, n=2):
    """
    Updates scalar curvature R(x) from Laplacian of \rho(x).
    """
    delta_rho = laplacian_operator @ rho
    return -alpha * (n - 1) * delta_rho

# 4. Define external scalar forcing fields
# Leftward: oxidizing field, pushes toward 1s
# Rightward: reducing field, pushes toward 0s
def external_field(x, oxidizing=True):
    """
    Returns +1 or -1 scalar based on field direction.
    """
    return 1.0 if oxidizing else -1.0

# 5. Evolution Step: Discrete Ricci + External Forcing
# At each step:
#   - update rho(x) via flux driven by geodesic action
#   - update R(x) via Ricci flow
#   - recompute external field
#   - total action couples real/imaginary curvature terms

# Future Extension:
#   - Replace scalar F_ext with a vector field (gradients)
#   - Treat F_ext as imaginary-valued connection over the manifold
#   - Use non-symplectic connection to update rho(x,t)

# NOTE:
# Staying in place (no transition) is least action
# But action is minimized easier in flat regions (low curvature) than wells
# Thus, geometry + external field together shape probabilistic evolution
