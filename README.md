# Oxi_Shapes
This repository contains the [Python](https://www.python.org/)-scripted source code for Oxi-Shapes. The open-sourced code is deisgned to be used in the Google [Colab](https://colab.google/) environment, which can be accessed online for free. 
# Scripts
An overview of each script is provided:
1. Figures: Several scripts
2. Application:
# Resources 
This repository contains the white paper, where the detailed mathematical basis of Oxi-Shapes is elaborated, and the experimental methods section, which provides further details on the scripts above and general procedures. 
# Data Availability
This repository contains the published data, and their metadata, used to compute the Oxi-shapes mentioned in the preprint.
