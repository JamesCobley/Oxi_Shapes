# Oxi_Shapes
This repository contains the [Python](https://www.python.org/)-scripted source code for the preprint entitled "Oxi-Shapes: The Theroem-derived Proteoform Geometry". The open-sourced code is deisgned to be used in the freely-available Google [Colab](https://colab.google/) environment. 
# Scripts
A breif overview of the script by use-case is as follows:
1. Figure_1. Composed of panels derived from [Fig_script_1](https://github.com/JamesCobley/Oxi_Shapes/blob/main/Fig_script_1.py) and [Fig_script_2](https://github.com/JamesCobley/Oxi_Shapes/blob/main/Fig_script_1.py). Extended_Data_Figure_1 was created from Fig_script_2 and the [ExF1](https://github.com/JamesCobley/Oxi_Shapes/blob/main/ExF1.py) scripts. 
2. Figure_2. 
3. Application. The Oxi-Shapes [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app was generated using the [app](https://github.com/JamesCobley/Oxi_Shapes/blob/main/App.py) script. The application can be accessed for free [online](https://oxishapes.streamlit.app/).
4. Simulations.
