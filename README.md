# Oxi_Shapes
This repository contains the [Python](https://www.python.org/)-scripted source code for the preprint entitled "Oxi-Shapes: The Theroem-derived Proteoform Geometry". The open-sourced code is deisgned to be used in the freely-available Google [Colab](https://colab.google/) environment. 
# Scripts
A breif overview of the script by use-case is as follows:
1. Figure_1. Composed of panels derived from [Fig_script_1](https://github.com/JamesCobley/Oxi_Shapes/blob/main/Fig_script_1.py) and [Fig_script_2](https://github.com/JamesCobley/Oxi_Shapes/blob/main/Fig_script_1.py). Extended Data Figure 1 was created from panels in the aforementioned scripts, and from the []() script. 
2. Figure_2. 
3. Application. The Oxi-Shapes streamlit app was generated using the [app](https://github.com/JamesCobley/Oxi_Shapes/blob/main/App.py) script.
4. Simulations. 
# Resources 
This repository contains the white paper, where the detailed mathematical basis of Oxi-Shapes is elaborated, and the experimental methods section, which provides further details on the scripts above and general procedures. 
# Data Availability
This repository contains the published data, and their metadata, used to compute the Oxi-shapes mentioned in the preprint.
